# **App Name**: Truck Calculator

## Core Features:

- SKU and Quantity Input: Allow the user to enter a SKU and quantity of items.
- Truck Calculation: Determine the number of trucks needed based on SKU, quantity, weight, and dimensions. An AI tool helps determine dimensions and packing factors when data is unavailable, and helps to estimate the number of trucks needed, considering stacking rules. Considers weight (max 42,000 lbs per truck) and space (48ft long truck).  If result is one and a half, round up to 2 trucks. The tool will determine if the order needs LTL (less than 14 ft), Half Truck (14-24 ft), or Full Truck (48ft).
- Display Truck Recommendation: Show the recommended truck type (LTL, Half Truck, or Full Truck) and the number of trucks to the user.

## Style Guidelines:
